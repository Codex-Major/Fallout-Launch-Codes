# Hello Johnsandwich!

# Fallout-Launch-Codes
Python script to generate possible launch codes for Fallout76

This script requires two things from a player:
  - Knowledge of a silo's FULL keyword
  - 8 silo code peices

# To begin:
In a terminal window run `python3 launchcodes.py`

Enter the keyword for either Site Alpha, Site Bravo, or Site Charlie.

Enter each of the 8 code peices from the corresponding silo site.

Read through the possibilities in the "ANAGRAM DETECTION" section to see the possible 8 digit launch codes.

# Example:
Silo: `Alpha`

Keyword: `MENDACIOUSLY`

Code peices: `A9 B9 F6 I2 K9 M6 N2 U6`

The accepted launch code in-game was `69992662`. Proves that this does, in fact, work.
